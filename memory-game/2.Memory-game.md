# Title: Memory game

- The steps I went through to build it
- What extra feature does it have
- What bugs does it have 
- Next version features
- How to play

### The Steps
1. First I wrote the mind map. That is listen the requirements and general steps.
2. Visualize the interaction and relation of different elements of the game.
3. Create the boiler. Prepare the basic things for creating any project. like `HTML file, CSS file IMAGE folder And BOOTSRAP framework etc...`
4. Start downloading `IMAGES` create general layout of the page
5. Search some staffs in `GOOGLE`, like how to flip a card
6. Start using `JAVASCRIPT` logics and methods to manipulating the cards and their images and also the interaction to click on the cards.
7. `TRY and ERROR`  operation to get better result.
8. Minimising the steps and the code line by using good and interchangeable variables.
9. Add extra features.
10. `Verifying and  Examining` if every thing is working ass intended.

### Extra Features
There are some features add and, some needed to be added.

- `Reset Buttone` to reload the page for playing one more.
- `Progress Indicatore` to let know the player how is his/her progress.
- limiting the number of try, 3 chances for each card, so that there will be winning and loosing in the game.
- Display congratulation if wins or sorry message if looses. 
- Add sound effect to the winning and loosing messages. 

### Bugs or Drawbacks (With Enter Key Only)
- Continue flipping the matched cards when played with the keyboards.
- Continue to display and make sound effect to the winning and loosing messages if you keep pressing `ENTER`. 
- The card is not stable when minimizing the page. 

### New Version Features
1. Fix the bugs obviously
2. Customizing the extra features, like mute the sound effect, let the player use his own images.
3. Add sound effect when cards matched.
4. Indicate the currently selected card. This helps the player when playing with `Keyboard`.  

### How To Play

It is very cool game, make you have fun.

1. By clicking twice what ever cards you want flip the card. 
2. If the match, they will stay otherwise turn back.
3. It is random selection of images, so no critical way to win, just guess.
4. You can play it even with keyboard, `ArrowUp, ArrowDownm ArrowRight, ArrowLeft` to navigate around and use `Enter` key to select
